# 🌀 Phase – Strong Through Every Phase of Motherhood

**Phase** is the first hormone-aware wellness and training platform designed specifically for mothers — from postpartum recovery to perimenopause and beyond.

We help moms reclaim their strength by understanding what truly drives their energy, performance, and wellbeing: **hormones**.

## 🌱 Why Phase?

From the moment you become a mother, your body enters a new era. Yet most health and fitness tools ignore the real engine behind how women feel and function: **hormonal shifts**.

Whether you're:
- Navigating postpartum recovery
- Balancing motherhood with a demanding career
- Feeling the early signs of perimenopause

**Phase meets you where you are.**

We believe that hormones aren’t a limitation — they’re a map. And we’re building the tools to read it.

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

Hormonal fluctuations impact:
- **Energy metabolism** (estrogen and progesterone affect glycogen use and fat oxidation)
- **Muscle recovery** (testosterone and estrogen influence muscle protein synthesis)
- **Sleep & mood** (progesterone, melatonin, and cortisol interplay)
- **Thermoregulation** (hot flashes, night sweats during perimenopause or postpartum)

Yet **95% of training plans** ignore hormonal variation entirely.  
And **80% of women** say they’ve never been taught how hormones impact performance, sleep, or recovery.

We're changing that — by integrating findings from:
- **Sports endocrinology**
- **Postnatal and perimenopausal physiology**
- **Behavioral science for habit adherence**
